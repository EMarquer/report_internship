Test report

## Abstract
The test is composed of 4 runs on grele, with:
- bptt 200, batch-size 1
- bptt 100, batch-size 2
- bptt 50, batch-size 4
- bptt 25, batch-size 8

Run has been interrupted by an overflow of disk space due to the detailed logs; next runs will used reduced logs.

Run time per epoch varies from 30 to 7 min.

## Results
At the end of each epoch, we see a spike in BPC, due to the first evaluation of the epoch (BPC is reinitialised to 0, 
causing a spike).
With any number of batch, while keeping the `bptt * batch_size` ratio, BPC and Validation BPC do not vary.

Even with 200 epochs, with batch size of 1, there is no trace of over-fitting.

Run time can be split over two set of epochs: before, and after the 15th epoch.
Before the 15th epoch, run is faster with more batches, with the exception of batch-size 8, which is slower than 
batch-size 2 and 4.
After the 15th epoch, run is slower with more batches.

To optimize run time, it is necessary to balance run time before 15 epochs.
If a high number of batches is planed (>50), between 2 and 4 batches are preferable, because the run time after epoch 15
has a lot of impact on global run time; however, if only a few epochs are planed (<20), a high number of batches is 
preferable, as run time before epoch 15 is the most important.

With current corpus, 2, 3 or 4 batches are the most interesting setup.

Decrease in run time is most probably due to the history of the upper layers, that needs multiple epochs to fill.

## Next steps
- Independent impact of batch number and sequence length:
    - Run with fixed batch number and varying sequence length
    - Run with fixed sequence length and varying batch number
- Impact of corpus length on optimal number of batch and sequences:
    - Run with varying sequence length and varying batch number over the full length corpus
- Number of parameters:
    - Increase the hidden layer size
- [Future] Transmission rate impact:
    - Compare optimal values of parameters, and BPC reached with varying transmission rate
