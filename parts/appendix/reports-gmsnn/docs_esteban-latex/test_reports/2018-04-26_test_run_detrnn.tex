\section*{Test run of detrnn.py}

Test report

by E. Marquer, 2018/04/26, Synalp and Universit√© de Lorraine

\subsection{Abstract}

Test to see time needed, with GPU and without, to run the basic model of
DetRNN.

\subsection{Paradigm}

With branch \emph{reimplement}, allocated time 30 min. Test run of
\emph{detrnn.py} with full log output, with and without \emph{cuda}. It
does not matter if learning ends, as test is only to get time
statistics.

\subsubsection{Node}

grimani-2, with GPU

\subsection{Results}

About 3 to 4 batch-sets are computed in 5 minutes without \emph{cuda}.
About 1 batch-set is computed in 1 s with \emph{cuda}.

Details:
\begin{itemize}
	\item without GPU: \href{https://gitlab.inria.fr/emarquer/awd-lstm-lm/blob/reimplement/logs/detrnn2018_4_26-16h39.log}{detrnn2018\_4\_26-16h39.log}
	\item with GPU: \href{https://gitlab.inria.fr/emarquer/awd-lstm-lm/blob/reimplement/logs/detrnn2018_4_26-16h41.log}{detrnn2018\_4\_26-16h41.log}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential ameliorations \& next steps}

Next step is to test the state-of-the-art version, but probably only
with \emph{cuda}.
