\subsection{Abstract}

A big memory leak is present in the model. One of the identified cause
is a malfunction in the history management system.

\subsection{Problem}

It seems simply detaching a hidden state is not enough:

With a graph:
\begin{lstlisting}
                        3.1 --------------------------- 3.2 -->
                         |                               |
        2.1 ----------- 2.2 ----------- 2.3 ----------- 2.4 -->
         |               |               |               |
1.1 --- 1.2 --- 1.3 --- 1.4 --- 1.5 --- 1.6 --- 1.7 --- 1.8 -->
\end{lstlisting}
where all nodes are hidden states, and each layer is a line, with a
transmission rate of 1 transmission every 2 hidden state.

When detaching every 2 hidden, with \lstinline![i.j]! a detached node,
the graph becomes:

\begin{lstlisting}
                        3.1 --------------------------- 3.2 -->
                         |                               |
        2.1 ----------- 2.2            [2.3]----------- 2.4 -->
         |               |                               |
1.1 --- 1.2    [1.3]--- 1.4    [1.5]--- 1.6    [1.7]--- 1.8 -->
\end{lstlisting}

But it should be:

\begin{lstlisting}
                        3.1 --------------------------- 3.2 -->
                         |                               |
        2.1 ----------- 2.2            [2.3]----------- 2.4 -->
                                                         |
1.1     1.2    [1.3]    1.4    [1.5]--- 1.6    [1.7]--- 1.8 -->
\end{lstlisting}

Or with a more aggressive strategy:

\newpage
\begin{lstlisting}
                        3.1 --------------------------- 3.2 -->
                                                         |
        2.1             2.2            [2.3]----------- 2.4 -->
                                                         |
1.1     1.2    [1.3]    1.4    [1.5]    1.6    [1.7]--- 1.8 -->
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Solution}

To solve the problem, keeping track of all history is necessary, and
with the way PyTorch works, it won't be a problem to keep references to
history before deleting them
